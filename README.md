## state-legislative-control

This project digitizes and combines two different sources of data on state legislative partisan control covering the years 1934-2021. The CSV files in `data/output` are organized by state and year, and have counts for the total, Democratic, Republican, and other members for each legislative body.

The modern dataset (2009-2021) comes from PDFs I digitized (`digitize.ipynb`) from the National Conference on State Legislatures [website](https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/partisan-composition.aspx). 

The historic dataset (1937-2008) is pulled from Carl Klarner's [project](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LZHMG3) on Harvard Dataverse.
